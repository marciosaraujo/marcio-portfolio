# Portfolio Template

A **portfolio** template built with **Astro** and deployed to the **Cloudflare Workers** edge. Projects are authored as Markdown/MDX content and organized by area (Infrastructure, Observability, Automation/CI-CD and Platform). Includes a light/dark theme.

🔗 **Live demo:** https://marcio-portfolio.marciosaraujo.workers.dev/

## Highlights

- ✅ Project showcase with a category-filterable gallery
- ✅ Dedicated page per project, with stack, demo and source links
- ✅ Light/dark theme (follows the system, with a manual toggle and persistence) that survives view transitions
- ✅ "Dev/SaaS minimalist" design: Inter + Space Grotesk type, ambient glow, subtle grid background, spotlight-on-hover cards and a blurred sticky header
- ✅ Smooth client-side navigation via Astro view transitions
- ✅ SEO with canonical URLs, OpenGraph and sitemap
- ✅ Markdown for the content
- ✅ Built-in observability logging (Cloudflare)

## How to add a project

Create a file in `src/content/projects/`, for example `my-project.md`:

```markdown
---
title: "Project name"
description: "A sentence about what it does."
category: "platform"           # infra | observability | automation | platform
tech: ["Terraform", "AWS"]
repoUrl: "https://github.com/your-username/my-project"
demoUrl: "https://my-project.example.dev"   # optional
featured: true                  # shows on the home page
coverImage: "/my-cover.svg"     # optional, in public/
date: 2026-06-01
---

## Problem
...
## Solution
...
```

The project shows up automatically in the gallery and (if `featured: true`) on the home page.

> The projects in `src/content/projects/` are examples — replace them with your own.

## Before publishing

1. Update your data in `src/consts.ts` (title, author, tagline, skills, links, categories).
2. Confirm `site` in `astro.config.mjs` (already points to the Worker URL).
3. Replace the example projects with your own.
4. Run `npm run check`, then `npm run deploy`.
